# AgriVerse

## Project Overview
AgriVerse is an AI-powered platform designed for early detection and management of plant diseases. Leveraging deep learning models trained on the PlantVillage dataset, the platform enables farmers to quickly identify diseases from plant leaf images. This early diagnosis helps reduce crop losses, improve yield, and supports sustainable farming practices.

## Features
- Upload images of plant leaves for disease detection.
- AI model predicts disease type with high accuracy.
- Provides detailed information and management recommendations for each disease.
- Responsive frontend built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.
- Flask backend serving the machine learning model via API.

## Tech Stack
React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS for frontend; Python, Flask for backend; TensorFlow and Keras for machine learning; deployed on Railway.app (backend) and Firebase Hosting (frontend).

## Deployment
- Backend API deployed on Railway.app for reliable cloud hosting.
- Frontend deployed on Firebase Hosting for fast, scalable access.

## Usage
Users can open the frontend application in their browser, upload clear images of affected plant leaves, which are sent to the backend AI model for analysis. The platform returns disease diagnosis along with helpful information and treatment recommendations.
